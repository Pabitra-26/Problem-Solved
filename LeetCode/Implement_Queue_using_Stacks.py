# Problem name: Implement Queue using Stacks
# Description: Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
# push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
# pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
# peek() -- Get the front element.
# empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
